# Amazons
## Setup
Initially, there are several queens in a chessboard. In this project, we will work with the following initial state:

</p>
<br>
A 6 x 6 chessboard with 2 white and 2 black queens positioned as shown in the picture. However, we could do slight modifications to the code and change the initial state of the game.

## Rules

The rules of the game are very simple. Two players (black and white) take turns until one of them cannot play anymore.
### Turn
At the beginning of the turn, the player moves one of his/her queens in the way they move in chess (vertically, horizontally or diagonally as many spaces as they want). However the queens can't go throught another queen nor take any the enemy's queens as you can do in chess. For example, here are all the possible movements for one queen in the initial state:
